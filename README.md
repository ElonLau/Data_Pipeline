# Data_Pipeline

This project aims to create a data pipeline using Python to assist with the sale of tickets. I'll use the Python database connector to perform data loading and to query the database programmatically.

In this project, the instruction states that I am provided with a ticket system database with ticket sales event
table (download data here). This table tracks all ticket sales for various events, including when
a third-party reseller submits their records of ticket sales for a new day. The records are
submitted as a CSV file. My task is to:
- Write the table definition DDL and use it to create the sales table.
- Read the CSV file and load the new sales records into the ticket sales table.

- The command line result should be displayed as follows:
